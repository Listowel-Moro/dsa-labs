## Lab Descriptions

### Matrix Multiplication
###### [See file](matrix-multiplication/MatrixMultiplication.java)
This lab involves implementing matrix multiplication in Java. Given two matrices, the code calculates their product if their dimensions are compatible (i.e., columns of the first matrix match the rows of the second).

**Key concepts covered:**
- 2D arrays
- Looping through multidimensional arrays
- Basic matrix operations

### Statistics of Grades
###### [See file](matrix-multiplication/StatisticsOfGrades.java)
In this lab, I worked on calculating statistics of student grades. The program:
1. Finds the maximum and minimum grades.
2. Calculates the average grade.
3. Displays a dynamic bar chart of grade distributions.

**Key concepts covered:**
- Array handling
- Calculating statistical values (min, max, average)
- Simple data visualization (text-based bar graph)

### Peak Columns
###### [See file](matrix-multiplication/PeakOfcolumn.java)
In this lab, I worked on finding the peak columns (elements that are both a maximum in their row and a minimum in their column). The program:
1. Takes a matrix input from the user.
2. Finds the peak columns in the matrix.
3. Displays the peak columns with their indices.

**Key concepts covered:**
- Ability to control user input and casting of data from one type to another
- Understanding of string formatting techniques to display in a readable and organized format
- Ability to analyze the problem requirements and develop algorithms to solve mathematical problems
